# ChatPulse Server

ChatPulse is a real-time user support and engagement platform. This is the server-side component of the application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- virtualenv (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChatPulse.git
   cd ChatPulse/server
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your specific details:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration.

5. Initialize the database:
   ```
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

### Running the Server

To run the server in development mode:

```
python run.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.
